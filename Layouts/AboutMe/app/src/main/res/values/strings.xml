        &#8226; Name: Matthew Spire
        \n&#8226; GitHub: https://github.com/matthew-spire
        \n&#8226; Location: Charleston, SC

        \n\nI have dabbled in a number of different programming languages, from Assembly (x86) to
        Python. I know a little about a lot, which means to say that I still have a lot to learn.
        I do have a foundation to build off of. I am excited to learn more about Kotlin and Android
        development.

        \n\nWhen it comes to goals, I hope to learn Kotlin and Android so that I can build a web
        app and a mobile app that utilize the same API. Hopefully my idea for a web app will take
        off and I will be able to support myself and my family.

        \n\nAs for hobbies, I like to walk my dogs, run, play video games, and golf. Watching
        movies and getting lost on YouTube is how I unwind.
